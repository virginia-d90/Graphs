# player needs to visit all 500 rooms

#as a player if I start in a room I would look at all of my exits--or rather directions i can travel
    #I choose a direction to take-not sure if random or rather choose one direction first
    #i make choices until i reach a dead end
    #i want to only go back through the entrance i used after i have gone through every other door
#I will be done when i have visited all 500 rooms
    #I will know the connections of each room to every other room 
#Need to keep track of rooms that have been visited --> visited rooms
#Need to keep track of directions traveled for each room --> visited exits 

Planning:
    ##each time the player moves add the direction to the traversal_path
    ##i feel like several helper methods will make this easier
    1.  create a method to track completeness of graph:
        probably a dict so I can keep track of rooms added and the paths visited for those rooms
              maze = {
                  0 : {'n':'?','s':'5','e':'?','w':'?'}
                  5 : {'n':'?','s':'?','e':'?'}
              }
        can get the info to populate from get_exits()

    2.  create a dfs method to move until a dead end is hit
        there isn't a destination vertex, just a room where all exits have been visited

    3. create a bfs method to use once you have hit a dead end 
        it will move backwards and find the first room to have a "?" in its direction values

    
    while len(maze) < len(room_graph):
        start player in current room
        check if room is in maze
        if not in maze add it using method 1
        create a place to store directions/paths that have not been explored
        check each direction for a room in maze to see if there is a "?" 
            if yes add it to the unexplored list
        if there is an unexplored path/direction
            use method 2 to find a new dead end
        else use method 3 to reverse the path until a room with an unexplored path is found
        if there isn't a reverse path i.e. you need to start choose a random door
